The problem with this version is that it takes too long to for the cube to find a solution. 
I can't see any evident infinite loops in the code, so i'm confident the codes fine.
A rubiks cube has 26,830,560 solved states and i was unable to write a function to generate these solved states. So issue might be because of this
