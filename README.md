# Rubiks-Cube-Solver
Intro to Artificial Intelligence final project

This is an attempt to showcase our efforts.

We could not find solutions that used COH and EOH algorithms on the internet for inspiration. So it took several trial and errors to come up with a reasonable solution


We have gathered all the versions of the codes for COH and EOH and their hybrid model to showcase our progress


All code versions have same input and output format. Simply enter scrambled cube state in the input field window popup. 


Example input: RRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGWWWWWWWWWOOOOOOOOOBBBBBBBBBYYYYYYYYY
