# Rubiks-Cube-Solver
Intro to Artificial Intelligence final project

This is an attempt to show the effort we put in. COH and EOH algorithm is not used in no rubiks cube algorithms i saw on the internet. So it was somthing needed to be done from scratch


I have gathered all the versions of the codes for COH EOH and their hybrid model to showcase my progress


All code versions have same input and output format. Simply enter scrambled cube state in the input field window popup. 


E.g input: RRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGWWWWWWWWWOOOOOOOOOBBBBBBBBBYYYYYYYYY
